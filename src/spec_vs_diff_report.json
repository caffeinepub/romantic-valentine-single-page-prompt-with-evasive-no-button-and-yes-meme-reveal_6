  "summary": "Diff adds a Valentine prompt/success UI with an evasive \"No\" button hook and romantic styling, but it does not show the required generated image asset under frontend/public, and it introduces backend and authentication/actor wiring changes that were explicitly out of scope / constrained.",

      "id": "REQ-5",
      "requirement": "Add the required generated image(s) to the frontend as static assets under frontend/public/assets/generated and render them directly from the frontend.",
      "reason": "The UI references the image at \"/assets/generated/good-choice-meme.dim_800x800.png\", but the diff summary does not include adding any file under frontend/public/assets/generated (no static image asset is shown as added).",

      "requirement": "Create a single-page Valentine prompt UI that asks exactly: \"Will you be my Valentine?\" with two prominent options: \"Yes\" and \"No\".",
      "reason": "The App.tsx prompt portion that would contain the exact main question and the Yes/No buttons is truncated in the diff, so the presence of the exact on-page question and both button labels cannot be verified from the provided evidence.",
